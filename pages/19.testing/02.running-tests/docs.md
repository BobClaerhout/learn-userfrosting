You can execute tests using the `test` Bakery command.

```bash
$ php bakery test
```

[notice=warning]UserFrosting's built-in integration tests use a temporary in-memory SQLite database. For testing to run successfully, you must have the `php-sqlite3` package installed and enabled. Alternatively, you can create a separate testing database and override the `test_integration` database settings in the `testing.php` [environment mode](/configuration/config-files) from your site sprinkle.[/notice]

The `test` command will fire all tests define in UserFrosting base system along with any tests defined by the sprinkles found in your app. Those tests are executed by [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).
